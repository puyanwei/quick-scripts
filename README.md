# Quick Scripts

Add buttons to the status bar to quickly execute scripts!

I found it annoying constantly typing in the terminal or finding the NPM script sidebar button to run my scripts so I created this simple application.

## Features

#### Adding a button

Add a button by opening the command palette (Command + Shift + P) and finding the quick scripts option by typing it in.

Once selected, add the script you would like to use. In this example we are using package.json and running a frontend project with storybook, so the script would be `yarn run storybook`.

Note that the terminal will always run at the root if your project, so it is recommended you prefix your script with `yarn --cwd <path> <command>`. For example if the package.json is in the next folder you would run `yarn --cwd ./next dev`.

Name the button to add it to the status bar. Button names are limited to 5 characters.

Button now shows up in the status bar. Clicking it will open a new terminal and run the script.

#### Removing a button

Delete a button by opening the command palette (Command + Shift + P) and finding the quick scripts option by typing it in.

Then select the button you wish to delete, or delete them all.

Once selected, this will reload VS Code and remove the button from the status bar.

## Bugs

This is my first VS code extension and I used this project to learn and get the experience of the process.

- Currently the extension does not seem to save state on the workspaces. I am working on a fix for this. For now if you do not close your project, the buttons will stay.
